Synopsis
> So you're interested in blogging? `{<3}` **Thank you** for 
considering AirPair a home to share your creativity and knowledge. The 
top 20% of posts on airpair.com <sup>[AirPair Posts](https://www.airpair.com/posts) Section (at airpair.com/posts)</sup>
get viewed on average more than 150,000 times within 12 months! Publishing
top content rarely comes with instant gratification. 40% of
posts submitted to the `community review` process do not make it
through to published. This guide includes background, guidelines 
and tips to best leverage community help to improve your post's ratings
and ultimately attract more readers. Developers of all levels of writing
beginner through advanced topics are welcome. **Read this guide in full
BEFORE submitting your post to the community.**

## 1. Community values

AirPair's mission is to share software knowledge. In our verbiage, being 
an *"expert"* does not necessarily involve mastering "cutting-edge" knowledge. 
An *AirPair Expert* is about attaiing enough proficientcy in both *technical knowledge* and *expression* to effectively communicate and teach beginner 
or advanced concepts.

Advantages of publishing on AirPair include *(1)* positioning yourself to get 
hired to consult around knowledge you present and *(2)* connecting with 
other experts in your domain that want to share similar passions by helping
refine and evolve your posts.

Publishing on AirPair is as much about learning through helping as learning 
through help. When deciding to publish here, you should be intersted in more 
than your own posts and either *(a)* be wanting to help others at least a few 
hours each month over live Airpair pair programming sessions or *(b)* already
reviewing posts by others.

## 2. An evolution in progress

### 2.1 Platform

AirPair Post Section <sup>1</sup> is one of fastest growing and most 
trafficked software blogs ever. That said, we recognize our tooling as 
half complete and due for more polish. Most folks perceive AirPair 
as big company. It's acutally run with lots of love `{<3}` by one person.
The authoring features usually get a wave of attenion every 3-6 months.

### 2.2 Community etiquette

We'd like you to be aware of and acknowledge the contributions of 10
distinguished **"Resident Authors"**, awarded the `{R}` badge for helping 
others and embodying the culture we want to grow. Please pay special attention 
to their feedback and opinions.

Reviews from other community members will come in many different flavors.
We're aiming to steer clear of short praise like *"Awesome post"* and utilize
the review system to facilitate intelligent discussion that leads to better
content and collaboration. Some folks have sweeter delivery than others 
and though your post may be excellent, and rated high by a reviewer, their 
initial feedback may mostly contain critique so as to avoid repeating things 
said and focus on what could be improved. Reviews are a powerful mechanism to
consider things with fresh perspective. Take ALL feedback seriously, even if
ultimately you completely disagree and choose to disregard everything someone
says, the process will benefit you and your readers. We ask you adopt a thick
skin and **thank all reviewers for taking time to read and comment even if you
don't like what was said**. 

Trolling and arguments are generally discouraged. There are no definitions or
processeses yet for inappropriate behavior. It's a good example of an area for
the community to decide as we continue moving forward.

** Tip ** if you've incorprated feedback from a review, reply to let the
reviewer know. They are able to update both their rating and comment at any 
time and will likely increase the stars given and replace previous critque with
praise.

## 3. Submission guidelines

*Last updated Aug 8, 2015*

When you start feeling your post is starting to look good enough to be seen by 
others, it's time to familiarize and incorporate the guidelines of this section
into your post. It's rare for folks to deeply review posts more than once. 
To get the most creative input, avoid reviewers having to point out things 
already covered here.

### 3.1 Long form posts & topics

<!-- Many different written formats conduct software knowledge successfully. One
 reason StackOverflow became successful was discipline and consistency around
 the Q/A format and types of questions accepted by the community.-->

The AirPair blog is focused on long form technical blog posts ideally
ranging from 1500-4000 words (including code blocks), though some all-time highest trafficked post have been between 10,000-15,000 words.

Posts usually fall into one of these types:

- **Tutorial** or step by step guide (beginner, intermediate or advanced)
- **Comparison** like "SQL vs NoSQL" or "AngularJS vs BackboneJS"
- **Show and tell** of a neat thing you built and open-sourced
- **Deep dive** on a specific language or framework internals or feature
- **Knowledge list** like "Top 10 mistakes ..." or "5 tips for ..."
- **Opinion piece** on *anything software* from academia to community activity
or reviews of new technologies and software services.

For reasons spanning UX, engagement / comprehension, SEO, Social Sharing and 
GitHub constraints, **post titles (the h1 element) should be less than 50 chars**
and mention the main technology. 

As long as a post is about software (including programming and non-programming disciplines like UX, Internet Marketing, Lessons from running a Software 
Startup etc.), we primarily encourage you to let your passions guide topic
choice. We don't mind if you aim to appeal to the masses or focus on something
niche to strike very deep with a few. Just make sure people understand and care
about your topic to get enough ratings to make it through the community review
stage and get published.

### 3.2 Original content

AirPair's Posts section is for original content only. (1) Do not submit content
already published elsewhere. (2) Even if published first on AirPair, do not
republish your post anywhere including your personal site. Not leaving content 
and it's associated acknowledgement of community contributions exclusively on 
airpair.com is likely to lead to your post being taken down and possibly or 
being banned publising again.

Under all circumstances, copyright content will be immediately removed. 
Google and reviewing existing posts similar titled posts before getting 
started. Post may be removed even if they look similar to ones published 
prior on another site.

### 3.3 Self promotion

The AirPair blog "is" a place for self promotion. Guidelines and tips
for personal and company promotion coming soon.

**Associate a professional avatar picture 
<sup>Manage AirPair avatars via [gravtar.com](http://en.gravatar.com/)</sup> with the email of your AirPair
account.** And connect at least two social profiles for credibility.

### 3.4 Formatting 

Posts should appear professionally formatted. By the length of this guide,
you can see we pay a lot of attenion to detail, including visual aspects. 
Sticking to pure markdown and avoiding hybrid html / inline css where possible
is the easiest way to keep things clean. We encourage authoring in the AirPair
Editor from the get go. The live rending feedback will help you keep things 
nice.

**Tip 1** The AirPair Editor live rendering panel is debounced according to 
how long your post is. At the start it will refesh almost instantly, but 
things slow to stop your browser hanging. To make the live view manually 
refresh at will focus by clicking on the rendered panel.

- - -

**Tip 2** Become a markdown master and explore everything from images / media, 
ordered / unordered lists, code blocks, blockquotes, **bold**, *italic*,
horizontal rules, line breaks, varying pargraph sizes and small sections to
utlize 'white space' and break up long blogs of text. Visually digestable 
content will cause less readers to give up and bounce.

### 3.5 Language

Refrain from coarse language and questionable socio-cultural statements,
including sexist and racist remarks.

Check spelling and grammar. As a guide there should be no more than
10 obvious mistakes per 1000 words.

** Tip ** Use a spell checker and if necesssary get a friend to review your
English before you submit.

### 3.6 Post structure

Unless you go viral, **90% of readers will arrive at your post via a search engine**. Both the platform and structure outlined here, have repetitively
evolved to optimize SEO and retaining short attention spans. 

#### 3.6.1 Synopsis

At the top of your post include a short summary introducing the idea, 
format, who the post is relevant for (i.e. level of developer / prerequisite
knowledge). Within 30 seconds readers should clearly know if the post is 
on-topic for what they are seeking and relevant to their experience.

Note the synopsis falls out of the Table of Contents (ToC) and the word *Synopsis* is considered a *pseudo heading* that is only for visual impact. Here is some example markdown for a synopsis:
````markdown
Synopsis
> So you're interested in blogging? **Thank you** for 
considering AirPair a home to share your creativity and knowledge `{<3}`. The 
top 20% of posts at airpair.com/posts 
get viewed on average more than 150,000 times within 12 months!
````

#### 3.6.2 Links

airpair.com gets crawled many times per day. Preview your post and make sure 
ALL links work. ***Tip:*** You'll drive jk crazy with 404 notifications if 
you don't properly prefix links with `http` etc. 

***Tip*** The more links you include in your post, especially up the top
of your content, the more likely a ready will click away and not finish. Where
possible utilize &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tags to move links into the 
auto-genearted *References* section down the bottom of your post.

#### 3.6.3 ToC, headings and subheadings

The Table of Contents (ToC) widget automatically grabs headings (\#\#,\#\#\#, 
\#\#\#\#) out of your markdown and renders them as your ToC. Headings are 
extremely important and one of the drivers of AirPairs search traffic success.

** 3.6.3.1 One heading (h1) to rule them all! **  
h1s (#) should not appear anywhere in your content. Correct markup includes a
single h1 element in any given html document. Having more than one h1 will
negatively impact your posts SEO.

** 3.6.3.2 Table of contents guidlines & tricks**  
A ToC should be short enough that it's container element does not go into
auto-scroll mode. 
- ***Tip 1*** To see your down the right side of your post open it in preview
mode. 
- ***Tip 2*** To keep your ToC a reasonable height, don't have more than one 
or two long headings spaning multiple lines in the ToC widget. 
- ***Tip 3*** (Like in this section) use psuedo headings (bold, bold-italic) 
instead of h5s. 
- ***Tip 4*** Consider breaking your post into multiple parts if it's still too long.

**3.6.3.3** ***Optimize search and seek***  
Your post will probably be on one of many tabs a user is skimming as they 
google for answers and instant gratification. Top posts provide both wholistic
value and value section by section even when considered in isolation. 

Reader are often searching for something VERY specific and one section may
be exactly what they need, but the rest of your post is not as relevant.
that helped the readers find your post and quickly seek to potentially the only
part they are interested in.

If each section of your post is valuable, but you use generic headings like 
"Introduction", "Conclusion", "Step 1", "Getting Started" readers searching
for content described in a sub-section is far less likely (1) to find your
post via search results (2) find your gold nuget before deciding it's too much
effort to scan your post to figure out if it has what they need.

Forcing yourself to think about what someone would type to find each section
will dramatically help you improve the overall structure of your post. If you
think you would need multiple keywords, a section may be better split out and
each concept explained seperately under it's own heading.

** 3.6.3.4 Numbering format**  
Numbering is optional. In some (usually longer) posts it can add value. In 
others really detracts with un-necessary visual clutter and diluted SEO. 
If you choose to number sections in your post, as used in this post the
format is `2.3.4.P` where `.` is used to indicate sub-subsection but is
not used to trail the number.

** 3.6.3.4 Heading gotcha's**  
1. Headings (especially h1) should be avoided in code-samples when possible.

#### 3.6.4 Code samples

Tripple check all code runs before submitting your post. Often readers are 
already overwhelmed and frustrated learning the subject matter. Commonly they 
can ignore how great your post is otherwise and leave negative comments if they 
loose time when code doesn't run unsure if it's your code sample or them doing
something wrong.  

**Supported language <sup>Languages supported by [the prism syntax highlighting plugin](http://prismjs.com/#languages-list)</sup> code samples MUST be correctly syntax highlighted**. ***Tip 1*** If it's not highlighting in the 
AirPair Editior, it won't highlight when published. *** Tip 2 *** A common confusion is the use of `markup` as the key to hightlight html. `markup`
can also be used for xml - hence the name ;).

<pre>&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;markup
&lt;example title="markdown for markup syntax highlighting"&gt;
Nice colors!
&lt;/example&gt;
&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;</pre>

```markup
<example title="markdown for markup syntax highlighting">
Nice colors!
</example>
```

#### 3.6.4 Media

Prefixed ALL image urls with `https` and NOT `http` or readers will get 
insecure warnings from their browser.

## 6. Random idiosyncrasies

- **New lines in the editor**. At some point we tried to get the editor to
auto generate new lines after 80 characters, but things went wrong and we'll
try again. A good practice is to manually add new lines just before the gray
line on the right edge of the editor. Without new lines, edits made by 
contributors will be difficult to see as git may track a whole paragraph 
instead of an 80 char chunk for simple spelling corrections.

- **If a supported language is not syntax highlighting**, email team at 
airpair, as it could be recently added or intentially not yet included in our 
custom build because we didn't want users downloading 100's of Kbs of un-used
language packs.
