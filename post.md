Synopsis
> So you're interested in blogging? `{<3}` **Thank you** for 
considering AirPair a home to share your creativity and knowledge. The 
top 20% of posts on airpair.com <sup>[AirPair Posts](https://www.airpair.com/posts) Section (at airpair.com/posts)</sup>
get viewed on average more than 150,000 times within 12 months! Publishing
top content rarely comes with instant gratification. 40% of
posts submitted to the `community review` process do not make it
through to published. This guide includes background, guidelines 
and tips to best leverage community help to improve your post's ratings
and ultimately attract more readers. Developers of all levels of writing
beginner through advanced topics are welcome. **Read this guide in full
BEFORE submitting your post to the community.**

## 1. Community values

AirPair's mission is to share software knowledge. In our verbiage, being 
an *"expert"* does not necessarily involve mastering "cutting-edge" knowledge. 
An *AirPair Expert* is about attaining enough proficiency in both *technical knowledge* and *expression* to effectively communicate and teach beginner 
or advanced concepts.

Advantages of publishing on AirPair include *(1)* positioning yourself to get 
hired to consult around knowledge you present and *(2)* connecting with 
other experts in your domain that want to share similar passions by helping
refine and evolve your posts.

Publishing on AirPair is as much about learning through helping as learning 
through help. When deciding to publish here, you should be intersted in more 
than your own posts and either *(a)* be wanting to help others at least a few 
hours each month over live Airpair pair programming sessions or *(b)* already
reviewing posts by others.

## 2. An evolution in progress

### 2.1 Platform

AirPair Post Section <sup>1</sup> is one of fastest growing and most 
trafficked software blogs ever. That said, we recognize our tooling as 
half complete and due for more polish. Most folks perceive AirPair 
as big company. It's acutally run with lots of love `{<3}` by one person.
The authoring features usually get a wave of attenion every 3-6 months.

### 2.2 Community etiquette

We'd like you to be aware of and acknowledge the contributions of 10
distinguished **"Resident Authors"**, awarded the `{R}` badge for helping 
others and embodying the culture we want to grow. Please pay special attention 
to their feedback and opinions.

Reviews from other community members will come in many different flavors.
We're aiming to steer clear of short praise like *"Awesome post"* and utilize
the review system to facilitate intelligent discussion that leads to better
content and collaboration. Some folks have sweeter delivery than others 
and though your post may be excellent, and rated high by a reviewer, their 
initial feedback may mostly contain critique so as to avoid repeating things 
said and focus on what could be improved. Reviews are a powerful mechanism to
consider things with fresh perspective. Take ALL feedback seriously, even if
ultimately you completely disagree and choose to disregard everything someone
says, the process will benefit you and your readers. We ask you adopt a thick
skin and **thank all reviewers for taking time to read and comment even if you
don't like what was said**. 

Trolling and arguments are generally discouraged. There are no definitions or
processes yet for inappropriate behavior. It's a good example of an area for
the community to decide as we continue moving forward.

** Tip ** if you've incorprated feedback from a review, reply to let the
reviewer know. They are able to update both their rating and comment at any 
time and will likely increase the stars given and replace previous critque with
praise.

## 3. Submission guidelines

*Last updated Aug 8, 2015*

When you start feeling your post is starting to look good enough to be seen by 
others, it's time to familiarize and incorporate the guidelines of this section
into your post. It's rare for folks to deeply review posts more than once. 
To get the most creative input, avoid reviewers having to point out things 
already covered here.

### 3.1 Content format & topic requirements

#### 3.1.1 Long form posts

<!-- Many different written formats conduct software knowledge successfully. One
 reason StackOverflow became successful was discipline and consistency around
 the Q/A format and types of questions accepted by the community.-->

The AirPair blog is focused on long form technical blog posts ideally
ranging from 1500-4000 words (including code blocks), though some all-time highest trafficked post have been between 10,000-15,000 words.

#### 3.1.2 Post types and topics

Posts usually fall into one of these `types`:

- **Tutorial** or step by step guide (beginner, intermediate or advanced)
- **Comparison** like "SQL vs NoSQL" or "AngularJS vs BackboneJS"
- **Show and tell** of a neat thing you built and open-sourced
- **Deep dive** on a specific language or framework internals or feature
- **Knowledge list** like "Top 10 mistakes ..." or "5 tips for ..."
- **Opinion piece** on *anything software* from academia to community activity
or reviews of new technologies and software services.

As long as a post is about software (including programming and non-programming disciplines like UX, Internet Marketing, Experience running a Software 
Business etc.), we encourage you to let your passions primarily guide topic
choice. We don't mind if you aim to appeal to the masses or focus on something
niche to strike very deep with a few. Just make sure people understand and care
about your topic to get enough ratings to pass community review and get published.

#### 3.1.3 Choosing a title

The title is the most important part of a post. Every charcater is 100x more 
imporant that one in the actual post and can be the difference between being
at the top of search engine resuls or never being discovered at all.

For reasons spanning UX, engagement / comprehension, SEO, Social Sharing and 
GitHub constraints, **post titles *(h1 element)* should be less than 50 chars**.

Mention at least the main technology if not multiple technologies you are
exploring in full (e.g. `AngularJS` is better than `Angular`), though you should
it up in your sub-headings to cover more combinations.

<!--1.  **Specific** - you should mention not only the technology you're working with (Angular, React, etc), but also the particular sub-topic.-->

Each word and the order of words can have dramatic implications. Consider:

*Title 1* 
> "Tic Tac Toe! Scope in Directives: Transclusion Scope, Template Scope for Angular"

*Title 2*
> "Transclusion and Template Scope in AngularJS Directives Demystified

**Tip 1** Avoid wasting words that are not relevant to the software aspects
you are exploring that would never be used to lead a user searching for what
your content covers. `Tick Tac Toe!` will send someone to a games website and
is essentially a waste of characters that could have been used to be found by
another phrase.

**Tip 2** Google sees combinations of sub-phrases by removing / including words.
- *Title 1* yields key-phrases:
  - By obvious sub-strings:
    - "Transclusion Scope"
    - "Template Scope for Angular" 
  - By removal of words:
    - "Scope Directives" 
    - "Directive Angular"
  - By repetition:
    - 3 x "Scope Angular"
    - 2 x "Scope Template"
    - 1 x "Scope Directives"
    - 2 x "Directive Scope"
- *Title 2* yields key-phrases:
  - By obvious sub-strings:
    - "Template Scope in Angular" 
    - "Scope in AngularJS"     
    - "Scope in AngularJS Directives" 
    - "AngularJS Directives" 
  - By removal of words:
    - "Transclusion Scope in AngularJS" 
    - "Template Scope in AngularJS" 
    - "Transclusion in AngularJS Directives"
    - 1 x "Transclusion Scope"
    - 1 x "Template Scope"
  - No repetition

**Tip 3** 1 Try to incorporate eye-catching words that evoke the value proposition 
of the post.

<!-- TODO, give examples of eye-catching words-->


### 3.2 Original content

AirPair's Posts section is for original content only. (1) Do not submit content
already published elsewhere. (2) Even if published first on AirPair, do not
republish your post anywhere - including your personal site. Not leaving content 
and associated acknowledgement of community contributions exclusively on 
airpair.com may lead to your post being taken down and possibly being banned
publising again.

Under all circumstances, copyright content will be immediately removed. 
Google and reviewing existing posts similar titled posts before getting 
started. Posts may be removed even if they look similar to ones published 
prior on other sites.

### 3.3 Self promotion

Both personal and company self promotion is encouraged within these 
guidelines:

- **Associate a professional avatar 
<sup>Manage AirPair avatars via [gravatar.com](http://en.gravatar.com/)</sup> with  your AirPair account.** 
- Connect at least two social profiles for credibility.

<!-- Guidelines for bio text and to go here-->
<!-- Guidelines for and company promotion to go here-->

### 3.4 Formatting 

Posts should appear professionally formatted. You can tell by the length of 
this guide, we pay a lot of attenion to detail, including visual aspects. 
Sticking to pure markdown and avoiding hybrid html and inline css where 
possible is the easiest way to keep things clean. 


**Tip 1** Author in the AirPair Editor from the get go. Live rending feedback 
will help you think about formatting and see things as you write.
- - -
**Tip 2** The AirPair Editor rendering panel is debounced according to 
how long your post is. At the start it refeshes almost instantly and slows 
as you go to stop your browser hanging. To make the rendering panel refresh at
will focus on the panel by clicking on it.
- - -
**Tip 3** Become a markdown master
<sup>Mastering Markdown takes an hour with the (Darling Fireball Guide)[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics]</sup> and explore 
elements like images, ordered / unordered lists, code blocks, blockquotes,
**bold** / *italic* font, horizontal rules and line breaks to create 'white
space'. Long blocks of text can be visually hard to digestable and cause 
readers to give up and bounce.

### 3.5 Language

Refrain from coarse language and questionable socio-cultural statements,
including sexist and racist remarks.

Check spelling and grammar. As a guide there should be no more than
10 obvious mistakes per 1000 words.

** Tip ** Use a spell checker and if necesssary get a friend to review your
English before you submit.

### 3.6 Post structure

Unless you go viral, **90% of readers will arrive at your post via a search engine**. Both the platform and structure outlined here, have evolved to 
optimize SEO and retaining short attention spans. 

#### 3.6.1 Synopsis

At the top of your post include a summary introducing the top-level idea, 
content format and who the post is relevant for (i.e. level of developer / 
prerequisite knowledge). In 30 seconds readers should know if the post is 
what they are seeking and relevant to their experience.

The synopsis falls out of the Table of Contents (ToC) and the word *Synopsis* is 
considered a *pseudo heading* i.e. only a heading in the visual sense. Here is 
some example markdown for a synopsis:
````markdown
Synopsis
> So you're interested in blogging? **Thank you** for 
considering AirPair a home to share your creativity and knowledge `{<3}`. The 
top 20% of posts at airpair.com/posts 
get viewed on average more than 150,000 times within 12 months!
````

#### 3.6.2 Links

airpair.com gets crawled many times per day. **Properly prefix links with `http(s)://`** to avoid driving jk crazy with 404 notifications.

As a general rule, the more links in your post, particularly up the top, the 
sooner readers will click off and not come back. Use links judiciously to
increase engagement.

**Tip 1** Double check all links by clicking them from the full preview view.
- - -
**Tip 2** The more links included in your post, particularly towards the top, 
the sooner most readers will click off your posts and not come back. Utilize &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tags to reduce link surface and move the exit paths
down to the auto-genearted *References* section at the bottom of your post.

#### 3.6.3 ToC, headings and subheadings

The Table of Contents (ToC) widget automatically grabs headings ( **\#\#** / **\#\#\#** / **\#\#\#\#** ) out of your markdown and renders them down the
right hand side of your post as table of links enabling the user to 
immmediately seek to any given section. 

Headings are extremely important and one of the drivers of AirPairs search traffic success so pay attention!

** 3.6.3.1 *One (`h1`) heading to rule them all!* **  
h1s (**#**) should NOT appear in your post markdown. Correct HTML includes a
single h1 element in any document. More than one h1 will
negatively impact your post's SEO.

**3.6.3.2 *Optimize for search and seek* **  
Your post will probably be on one of many tabs a reader seeks through as they 
google for instant gratification. Top posts provide both wholistic
value and compartmentalized value in each section when considered in isolation. 

Readers often searching for VERY specific things and one section in your post 
may be exactly what they need, but the rest irrelevant. Well chosen headings 
help readers find your post using search engines and quickly seek to the 
relevant content before giving up when unsure if the effort to scan your post
is worth it.

**Tip 1** Avoid headings like "Introduction", "Conclusion", "Step 1", "Getting Started" that will inhibit the content in those sections being found.
- - -
**Tip 2** Think about what readers would type to find each section
in isolation. This will dramatically help your consitent the overall structure 
and flow of your post and identify when it may be better split out multiple
concepts under their's own headings.

** 3.6.3.2 *ToC and heading lengths* **  
A ToC should be short enough that it's container element does not render in
css auto-scroll mode. To keep your ToC a reasonable height, don't have more than one or two long headings spaning multiple lines in the ToC widget. 

**Tip 1** Use psuedo headings (Like in this section) instead of h5 and h6.
- - -
**Tip 2** Consider breaking a post into multiple parts if you can't figure
out how to keep the ToC a resonable length.


** 3.6.3.4 *Numbering format* **  
Numbering is optional. In some (usually longer) posts they can add value. In 
others it can detract with un-necessary visual clutter and diluted SEO. 
If you choose to number sections in your post, copy the format in this post.

** 3.6.3.4 Gotcha's**  
1. Try avoid headings (especially h1) in code-samples when possible.

#### 3.6.4 Code samples

Tripple check all code runs before submitting your post. Readers are often
already overwhelmed and frustrated learning the subject matter. Commonly they 
ignore how great your post is and leave negative comments if they 
loose time when code doesn't run unsure if it's your code sample or them doing
something wrong.  

**Supported language <sup>Languages supported by [the prism syntax highlighting plugin](http://prismjs.com/#languages-list)</sup> code samples MUST be correctly syntax highlighted**. ***Tip 1*** If it's not highlighting in the 
AirPair Editior, it won't highlight when published. *** Tip 2 *** A common confusion is the use of `markup` as the key to hightlight html. `markup`
can also be used for xml - hence the name ;).

<pre>&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;markup
&lt;example title="markdown for markup syntax highlighting"&gt;
Nice colors!
&lt;/example&gt;
&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;</pre>

```markup
<example title="markdown for markup syntax highlighting">
Nice colors!
</example>
```

#### 3.6.5 Media

** 3.6.5.1 *https* **  
Prefixed ALL image urls with `https` and NOT `http` or readers will get 
insecure warnings from their browser.

** 3.6.5.2 *Tile images* **  
The relevance, clarity and professionalism of the main tile image used to represent a post is VERY important. The tile image gets used not only in
the header of a post, but in the "tiles" list view of the Posts section,
tagged collections of posts, (eventually) on your AirPair profile,
in sharing to facebook & linkedIn via the `ogImage` tag, tweets by @airpair
and (soon) in weekely content digest emails.

Potential readers will judge pre-judge your post similar to the way people 
"judge a book by it's cover". Follow the following guidelines:

1. Make your tile relevant. Random images & artwork are discouraged.
2. Use a solid color or pattern as the images background.
3. Incorporate one logo or even multiple logos of the technilogies
being explored in your content.
4. Optionally incorporate the airpair logo <sup>AirPair logo uploaded to an [issue for this posts's repo](https://github.com/airpair/authoring-guide/issues/1)</sup>
5. Host your image somewhere that supports https. imgur, github.io or even
the issues section of the repo created for your post as good options.
6. The image size and dimensions should be large enough for social
sharing, but not too big to take un-necessarily bandwidth and time to load.
Facebook App Tiles (810x450) make a happy medium.  Must be over 640px in width, so that it will be flush with the width of the post.

** Tip 1 ** Use a tool like Canva<sup>[canva.com](https://www.canva.com)</sup>, it's a fast way to create images in a browser. You can even start from their "Facebook App" template to get the right dimensions. Going forward, you can also upload your images, and should you need high-quality free images try FreeImages.com<sup>[freeimages.com](http://www.freeimages.com/)</sup>.
- - -
** Tip 2 ** Often the bottoms of tile images get cut off when shown in the 
list view so place more importance on the top parts vs bottom parts of your
image.

<!-- ## ? Forking -->

## 6. Random idiosyncrasies

- **New lines in the editor**. At some point we tried to get the editor to
auto generate new lines after 80 characters, but things went wrong and we'll
try again. A good practice is to manually add new lines just before the gray
line on the right edge of the editor. Without new lines, edits made by 
contributors will be difficult to see as git may track a whole paragraph 
instead of an 80 char chunk for simple spelling corrections.

- **If a supported language is not syntax highlighting**, email team at 
airpair, as it could be recently added or intentially not yet included in our 
custom build because we didn't want users downloading 100's of Kbs of un-used
language packs.
